# A Terminal Coalgebra Theorem in HoTT

Directory [code](https://github.com/niccoloveltri/aczel-mendler/tree/main/code) contains a proof of Aczel-Mendler terminal coalgebra theorem in Cubical Agda.  
Directory [code-var](https://github.com/niccoloveltri/aczel-mendler/tree/main/code-var) contains a variant of the proof that works for building the terminal coalgebra of the powerset functor.  

The formalization type-checks with Agda 2.6.2 and the following version of the Cubical library:
